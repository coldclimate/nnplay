# Quick and dirty Neural Network experiments

Needs Python3

There's not a lot here but it should get you started.  I've included a couple of pretrained sets of weights.

* requirements.txt - all the libraries you need - run 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' to install
* bbc.hdf5 - a pretrained set of weights based on bbc.learn
* bbc.py - has lines for training from raw text and running from pretrained sets
* bbc.learn - a huge list of BBC programmes
* places.hdf5 - a pretrained set of weights from a 45k long list of UK Place anmes.  Not great, your milage may vary
* places.py - lots the weights and runs.  Produces a lot of white space, you probably want to push it though '| sort'
